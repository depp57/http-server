# http3-server

A lightweight and minimal HTTP server implemented in Go for learning purposes, supporting HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 (QUIC).

This project is not a complete implementation and focuses on simplicity. A lot of features are missing.

Additionally, this is one of my first projects in Go, so there may be areas for improvement.


TODO :
- [ ] implement http2
- [ ] implement http3
